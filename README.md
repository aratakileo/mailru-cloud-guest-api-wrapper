### How to use
To get a list of links to send a request to form a link stream, then you will need the following code:
```py
from mailru_cloud_guest_api import MailruCloudDispatcherApiRequester

dispatcher_api_requester = MailruCloudDispatcherApiRequester()

print(dispatcher_api_requester.request_answer)
```

If there are no problems, then this code will output a dictionary containing various kinds of links to request a stream link. If something went wrong, `None` will be returned.

To send a new request, use the following method:
```py
print(dispatcher_api_requester.send_request())
```

To generate a new request link, use the following method:
```py
print(dispatcher_api_requester.generate_request_link())
```

To get a stream link to download a file, you will need the following code:
```py
from mailru_cloud_guest_api import MailruCloudFileStreamLinkGenerator

# replace `https://cloud.mail.ru/public/file_id` to your public link
file_stream_link_generator = MailruCloudFileStreamLinkGenerator('https://cloud.mail.ru/public/file_id')

print(file_stream_link_generator.file_stream_link)
```

If there are no problems, then this code will output a stream link. If something went wrong, `None` will be returned.

To generate a new stream link, use the following method:
```py
print(file_stream_link_generator.generate_link())
```

To download a file by stream link, use following method:
```py
# replace `my_file.zip` to the filename as which the downloaded file will be saved
print(file_stream_link_generator.download('my_file.zip'))
```
